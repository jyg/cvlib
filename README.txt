`pix_opencvlib` is a fork of Antoine Villeret's `pix_opencv` library, merged with the objects i wrote before in my former `cvlib` library. 
`pix_opencv` is a Puredata library for real-time video processing : blob tracking, contours extracting, motion flow computation... It is based on work by Yves Degoyon, Lluis Gomez i Bigorda and Antoine Villeret, and uses `OpenCV` and `Gem`.
For more details, please visit https://github.com/avilleret/pix_opencv .

`cvlib` enabled low level features for contour processing. The goal of this fork is to include those features (the best of two worlds, `cvlib` & `pix_opencv`) in `pix_opencvlib`.
