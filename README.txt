`cvlib` is a puredata opencv extension library, to be used beside Antoine Villeret's `pix_opencv` library.
`pix_opencv` is a Puredata library maintained by Antoine Villeret, for real-time video processing : blob tracking, contours extracting, motion flow computation... It is based on work by Yves Degoyon and Lluis Gomez i Bigorda, and uses `OpenCV` and `Gem`.
