`cvlib` is a puredata OpenCV extension library that enables low level features for individual cvContours processing. It can be used beside Antoine Villeret's `pix_opencv` library.

(`pix_opencv` is a Puredata library maintained by Antoine Villeret, for real-time video processing : blob tracking, contours extracting, motion flow computation... It is based on work by Yves Degoyon and Lluis Gomez i Bigorda, and uses `OpenCV` and `Gem`.
